# Machine Learning fir Inorganic Double Perovskite

## 1 Data Preparation

Using material project API to obtain neccessary information.

## 2 Generating combination

Using pythons cript to generate different theoretical combination of A, B1, B2 and X corresponding to the formula of An inorganic double perovskite structure A2B1B2X.

## 3 Generating descriptor file

Construct feature spaces for each theoretical combination and real structure data

## 4 Feature selection and Machine Learning

Using pearson, lasso for feature selection and conduct gaussian process regression and ridge regression for prediction properties of the theoretical combinations.
